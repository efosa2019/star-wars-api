There are three features available in this project.

List all the Star Wars characters by first and last name. Use swapi (Star Wars API) for this. The following GET request will retrieve a list of characters and their related information https://swapi.dev.api/people.

Display additional information about the characters when their names are clicked. The user should also be able to hide this information again. You can pick a couple of properties to show based on what you get from the API.

Implement a search feature allowing the user to filter the characters based on their first name or last name.
